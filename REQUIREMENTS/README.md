# YAPPY Engine Requirements Documentation

This directory contains the comprehensive requirements and design documentation for the YAPPY Engine distributed data processing system. The documentation has been organized into focused sections for easier navigation and understanding.

## ðŸ†• New Architecture Documents

**Important**: The YAPPY Engine architecture has been significantly simplified. The engine is now a pure orchestration layer that coordinates simple gRPC services (modules) through configuration-driven pipelines.

## Quick Start Guide

### For the New Architecture

If you're working with the new simplified architecture, start here:

1. **[01-overview-and-principles.md](01-overview-and-principles.md)** - Understand the orchestration model
2. **[13-module-registration-flow.md](13-module-registration-flow.md)** - Learn how modules are registered
3. **[15-grpc-first-implementation.md](15-grpc-first-implementation.md)** - Understand the gRPC-only approach
4. **[14-connector-configuration.md](14-connector-configuration.md)** - See how data enters the system

### For Understanding the Full System

1. Start with **[01-overview-and-principles.md](01-overview-and-principles.md)** to understand the project goals
2. Read **[06-module-management.md](06-module-management.md)** to understand module architecture
3. Review **[02-bootstrap-and-setup.md](02-bootstrap-and-setup.md)** to understand how the system starts
4. Explore specific technical areas based on your interests

## Key Concepts

### New Simplified Architecture
- **Pure Orchestration**: Engine contains no business logic, only routing
- **Simple Modules**: gRPC services implement just 3 methods (ProcessData, GetServiceRegistration, Health)
- **Explicit Registration**: CI/CD must register modules using CLI with engine endpoint
- **Configuration-Driven**: All routing determined by pipeline configuration
- **Language Agnostic**: Any language with gRPC support can implement a module

### Core Technologies
- **gRPC**: Synchronous inter-service communication
- **Kafka**: Asynchronous message passing
- **Consul**: Service discovery and configuration
- **Protobuf**: Cross-language data serialization
- **Micronaut**: Modern JVM framework

### Design Principles
- **100% Real Integration Tests**: No mocks in integration tests
- **No Infrastructure in Modules**: Modules know nothing about Consul/Kafka
- **gRPC-First Development**: Initial implementation uses only gRPC
- **Flexible Deployment**: Support for containerized and kubernetes deployments
- **Production-Ready**: Built for real-world scenarios

## Document Maintenance

These documents are derived from the original `current_instructions.md` file and represent the current state of the project as of the last update. They should be kept in sync with the implementation as the project evolves.

### Contributing
When updating documentation:
1. Keep sections focused and concise
2. Use concrete examples where possible
3. Maintain consistency with existing terminology
4. Update the index when adding new sections
