# Current Status and Achievements

## Self-Contained Engine Testing (COMPLETED)

We have successfully refactored the yappy-engine to be completely self-contained, with no dependencies on external modules during testing.

### Key Achievements

#### 1. Created DummyPipeStepProcessor
- Test-only gRPC service implementing the PipeStepProcessor interface
- Allows testing engine orchestration without real modules
- Validates the engine's ability to coordinate pipeline steps

#### 2. Implemented Local Service Discovery
- Added support for `local.services.ports` configuration
- Engine can connect to services on localhost without Consul
- Crucial for production environments where modules may not participate in Micronaut's service discovery
- Example configuration:
  ```yaml
  local:
    services:
      ports:
        echo-service: 50051
        chunker-service: 50052
  ```

#### 3. Fixed Kafka Topic Timing Issues
- Implemented `waitForTopics` method using Reactor
- Handles asynchronous topic creation gracefully
- Prevents test failures due to timing issues
- Ensures topics exist before attempting to produce/consume

#### 4. Created Integration Tests
- **EngineWithDummyProcessorIntegrationTest**
  - Demonstrates full pipeline processing
  - Uses standalone gRPC server
  - Validates end-to-end flow
  
- **KafkaPipelineIntegrationTest**
  - Tests Kafka forwarding functionality
  - Validates message serialization/deserialization
  - Ensures proper topic routing
  
- Both tests use real Kafka and Apicurio Schema Registry via Testcontainers

## Architecture Improvements

### 1. Standalone gRPC Servers
- Modules run as standalone gRPC servers
- Not managed by Micronaut framework
- Better isolation and deployment flexibility
- Supports modules written in any language

### 2. Flexible Service Discovery
- GrpcChannelManager checks localhost configuration first
- Falls back to Consul discovery if local config not found
- Supports both deployment models:
  - Tightly-coupled (localhost)
  - Distributed (Consul-based)

### 3. Consistent Transport Handling
- Both gRPC and Kafka transports treated uniformly
- All operations are asynchronous
- Accept PipeStream messages as common format
- Simplifies pipeline step implementation

## Partial Implementations

### Service Registration States
Current state of implementation:
- `ServiceStatusAggregatorTest` exists for testing status aggregation
- Engine doesn't track detailed registration states during process
- Can be tested more thoroughly in uber-integration tests
- Foundation exists for future enhancement

### Moto Integration (In Progress)
While Apicurio Registry integration is complete, AWS Glue Schema Registry support needs:
1. Create Moto Test Resource
2. Implement schema registration process
3. Create integration tests using Moto

## Recent Architecture Decisions

### Module Independence
- Modules are completely independent of engine runtime
- Can be developed and tested separately
- Simplifies module development

### Engine-Managed Registration
- Engine handles all Consul registration for modules
- Modules don't need Consul client dependencies
- Reduces complexity for module developers

### Configuration-Driven Routing
- All routing decisions based on pipeline configuration
- No hardcoded service names or addresses
- Supports dynamic reconfiguration

## Test Infrastructure

### Testcontainers Setup
Successfully integrated:
- Consul container for service discovery
- Kafka container for messaging
- Apicurio Registry for schema management
- All containers managed automatically in tests

### Test Resource Management
- Custom test resources for each infrastructure component
- Automatic startup/shutdown
- Port management and configuration injection

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Separation of Concerns** - Clear boundaries between engine and modules
2. **Test-First Approach** - Caught many issues early
3. **Real Services in Tests** - No mocks ensures realistic behavior
4. **Flexible Configuration** - Supports multiple deployment models

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Timing Issues** - Solved with reactive programming patterns
2. **Service Discovery** - Dual approach (local + Consul) provides flexibility
3. **Schema Management** - Centralized in registry, not embedded in services
4. **Test Complexity** - Managed through careful resource management

## Technical Debt Addressed
1. Removed tight coupling between engine and modules
2. Eliminated hardcoded service references
3. Standardized on protobuf for all inter-service communication
4. Created clear extension points for new transport types

## Performance Considerations
1. gRPC channels are reused via channel manager
2. Kafka consumers use efficient partition assignment
3. Schema caching reduces registry lookups
4. Reactive patterns prevent blocking operations

## Security Preparations
1. Authentication stub in place for future implementation
2. Service whitelist configuration ready
3. ACL token support in Consul client
4. TLS/mTLS support in gRPC channels (configuration ready)
