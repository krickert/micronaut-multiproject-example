# YAPPY: Another Pipeline Processor: YAPPY

## Abstract
This is a full featured application that implements a dynamic pipeline for creating multiple indexes through a scabale container-based 
microservice architecture where the servi

The goal is to have a low cost, free, enterprise-grade secure document index.

The overall pipeline approach is decentralized - information is shared between one another in a control plane and configuration changes 
happen in near real time.

The idea here is that each pipeline step acts independent of one another.  

Here's an example chart of the pipeline:




## Mission

The mission goals:
1. Easy to install - the ecosystem is deployable to either a cloud environment or a localized laptop for development
2. Free - built with 100% open source projects
3. Streaming orchestration - documents are indexed through a network of pipelines either synchronously or asynchronously.
4. gRPC services + Kafka - all services are built on a common gRPC platform 
5. Admin interface - administration of the pipelines are done through a graph
6. Rapid pipeline development in any language - a user only needs to implement a single function and can deploy a service in minutes
7. Standardized monitoring - 
8. Secure - utilizes multiple configurable security standards
9.
