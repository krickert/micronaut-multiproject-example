### 3. Update Section VII: Detailed Task for Jules AI

This section needs the most significant update based on the admin controllers you've now implemented.

* **If the `AdminSetupController`, `AdminKafkaController`, `AdminStatusController` cover most of what was intended for "Jules AI" regarding general admin APIs, then:**
    * The introduction to Section VII should be revised. It was focused on "Engine-Managed Module Information & Registration Control."
    * We need to assess which of the four specific API endpoints listed in Section VII are:
        1.  Covered by the existing new controllers (e.g., parts of `AdminSetupController.java` might relate to listing module *definitions* if they are part of the cluster config it handles).
        2.  Still pending.
        3.  No longer needed or are handled differently (e.g., by the gRPC service `YappyModuleRegistrationServiceImpl.java`).

**Example: Revising Section VII API Endpoints**

Let's take the first API from the original Section VII:

1.  **List Configured Modules:**
    * **Endpoint:** `GET /api/admin/modules/definitions`
    * **Original Task:** "Get `PipelineModuleMap` from DCM..."
    * **New Status (Suggestion):** "This functionality might be partially covered by `GET /api/setup/clusters` in `AdminSetupController.java` if cluster details include module definitions. Alternatively, if a dedicated endpoint is still needed, its implementation status is TBD. The `DynamicConfigurationManagerImpl.java` holds `PipelineClusterConfig` which contains the `PipelineModuleMap`."

We would go through each of the four API endpoints in Section VII like this.

## What's Needed (Next Steps Section in `current_instructions.md`)

This section should flow from the "Current Focus" and also include broader goals.

**Suggested Points for "What's Needed / Next Steps":**
This is a starting point. You can tell me which parts you'd like to refine or if you want to focus on a specific section of `current_instructions.md` first. The information about the failing tests is particularly important for defining the immediate next steps.
