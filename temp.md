# Summary of Mermaid Diagrams Added to current_instructions.md

I've successfully added 5 Mermaid diagrams to visualize the YAPPY Engine architecture and flows:

## 1. Deployment Architecture Diagram (Line 135)
- Shows how Engine+Module pairs are deployed in containers/pods
- Illustrates the infrastructure services (Consul, Kafka, Schema Registry)
- Demonstrates that modules have no direct access to infrastructure
- Shows engine-to-engine proxying connections

## 2. Bootstrap Flow Diagram (Line 239)
- Illustrates the engine startup and configuration loading process
- Shows the sequence from main application through bootstrap manager
- Demonstrates configuration seeding and loading from Consul
- Shows event-driven initialization of components

## 3. Request Processing Flow Diagram (Line 331)
- Shows the normal flow when everything is healthy
- Illustrates how external systems use ConnectorEngine as entry point
- Demonstrates the orchestration through PipeStreamEngine
- Shows both Kafka and gRPC routing options

## 4. Module Discovery Flow Diagram (Line 440)
- Shows how engines discover modules through Consul
- Demonstrates localhost-first priority logic
- Illustrates channel creation and caching
- Notes where engine-to-engine proxying would be triggered

## 5. Engine-to-Engine Proxying Flow Diagram (Line 498)
- Illustrates what happens when a local module is down
- Shows how engines discover other engines with the required module
- Demonstrates the forwarding of entire requests between engines
- Shows status updates to reflect proxying state

All diagrams use consistent styling:
- Engines: Blue (#4a90e2)
- Modules: Teal (#50e3c2)
- Infrastructure: Orange (#f5a623)
- External Systems: Pink (#f9f)

The diagrams effectively visualize the key architectural concepts:
- Modules never touch Consul
- Engines handle all orchestration
- Engine-to-engine forwarding for resilience
- Localhost-first processing
- Configuration flows from Consul through engines
