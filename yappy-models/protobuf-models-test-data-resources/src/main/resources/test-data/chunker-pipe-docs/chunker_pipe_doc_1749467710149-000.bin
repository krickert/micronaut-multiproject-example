text/plain"$Multi-Module Container Test Document*Ñ	This is a comprehensive test document designed to demonstrate the power of the Yappy
pipeline processing system with multiple processors running in real Docker containers.

The document contains enough text to be meaningfully chunked at different sizes.
In the first section, we explore how different chunking strategies can affect the
downstream processing. Smaller chunks (300 tokens) provide more granular semantic
understanding, while larger chunks (1000 tokens) maintain more context.

The second section discusses embedding models. The ALL_MINILM_L6_V2 model is optimized
for English text and provides fast, efficient embeddings. The multilingual model
supports multiple languages and is better for international content.

By processing this document through two different chunking strategies and two different
embedding models sequentially, we accumulate chunks from both chunkers and embeddings
from both models, demonstrating the pipeline's ability to enrich documents progressively.

This test validates that our Consul-based service discovery and configuration management
correctly handles multiple processing steps with different configurations,
all running in real Docker containers managed by Micronaut test resources.
