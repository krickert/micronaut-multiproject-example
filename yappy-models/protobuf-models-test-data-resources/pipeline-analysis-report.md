# Pipeline Data Flow Analysis Report

## Summary

The analysis reveals significant issues in the data flow between pipeline steps:

1. **Document Loss**: Only 1 out of 2 documents made it through the entire pipeline
2. **ID Mismatch**: Document IDs are changing between Tika and Chunker stages
3. **No Embeddings**: The embedder processed documents but did not generate any embeddings

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Tika Output (2 documents)
- **Document 1**: ID `doc-abc`
  - Body: "Hello, this is a test document for Tika parsing!" (48 chars)
  - Title: EMPTY ⚠️
  - Has blob data (48 bytes, text/plain)
  
- **Document 2**: ID `doc-async-abc`
  - Body: "Hello, Yappy Async!" (19 chars)
  - Title: "Async Test Doc"
  - Has blob data (19 bytes, text/plain)

### 2. Chunker Output (2 documents, but different IDs!)
- Both documents have ID `test-doc-multi-001` ⚠️
- Different content than Tika output - appears to be test data
- First document: No semantic results
- Second document: 2 chunks created, but no embeddings

### 3. Embedder Output (1 document)
- ID: `test-doc-multi-001`
- Has 2 chunks from chunker
- **CRITICAL**: No embeddings generated for any chunks ⚠️

## Critical Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Document ID Mismatch
The documents from Tika (`doc-abc`, `doc-async-abc`) are not found in the Chunker output. Instead, the Chunker has documents with ID `test-doc-multi-001`, which appears to be different test data.

**Root Cause**: The test data directories contain different test scenarios, not a continuous pipeline flow.

### Issue 2: No Embeddings Generated
The embedder received 2 chunks but did not generate any embeddings:
- All chunks have `vector size: 0`
- No named embeddings were created

**Possible Causes**:
1. Embedder service might be failing silently
2. Configuration issue with the embedding model
3. Missing or invalid embedding model configuration

### Issue 3: Empty Fields
Several fields that might be required are empty:
- `embedding_config_id` is empty in both Chunker and Embedder outputs
- `source_uri` and `source_mime_type` are empty in Tika output
- Title is missing in one Tika document

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Test Data Consistency**: The test data should represent a real pipeline flow where the same documents progress through each stage

2. **Check Embedder Configuration**: 
   - Verify the embedding model is properly configured
   - Check if `embedding_config_id` is required but missing
   - Review embedder logs for errors

3. **Validate Required Fields**:
   - Ensure all required fields are populated at each stage
   - Add validation to prevent documents with missing critical fields from progressing

4. **Add Pipeline Tracing**:
   - Implement consistent document ID tracking through all stages
   - Add logging to track document flow and transformations

5. **Test with Real Pipeline**: Run an actual end-to-end test with real documents flowing through Tika → Chunker → Embedder to verify the pipeline works correctly
