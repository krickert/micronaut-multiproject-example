# Yappy Container Build Summary

## What We've Done

1. **Fixed Docker Development Environment**
   - Removed local registry container (was conflicting with port 5000)
   - Configured to use external NAS registry at `nas:5000`
   - Fixed Kafka health check to use correct path
   - All services are now healthy and running

2. **Built Yappy Containers**
   - Created manual build script to work around Gradle configuration issues
   - Successfully built 3 containers:
     - `nas:5000/yappy/tika-parser:latest` (420MB)
     - `nas:5000/yappy/chunker:latest` (340MB)
     - `nas:5000/yappy/echo:latest` (332MB)

## Next Steps

### 1. Configure Docker Desktop for Insecure Registry

Before you can push images to your NAS registry, you need to configure Docker Desktop:

1. Open Docker Desktop preferences
2. Go to Docker Engine settings
3. Add the following to the JSON configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "insecure-registries": ["nas:5000"]
   }
   ```
4. Click "Apply & restart"

### 2. Push Images to Registry

After configuring Docker Desktop, run:
```bash
cd /Users/krickert/IdeaProjects/yappy-work/yappy-containers
./push-images.sh
```

### 3. Verify Images in Registry

Check that images were pushed successfully:
```bash
# List all repositories
curl http://nas:5000/v2/_catalog

# List tags for a specific image
curl http://nas:5000/v2/yappy/tika-parser/tags/list
```
